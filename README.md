# simpler_platformer_unity3d
- This a simple 2d platformer game in unity3D.   

- It is part of my upcoming series (Learning Unity3D)  
Currently it is a work in progress and does not work.  
   
- I am following tutorials so There might be alot of overlap with other peoples work but its purpose is to only learn and not plagerize other peoples work. I will try to link all the help when I am done with the project.
